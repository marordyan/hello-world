Looking up at the stars, I know quiet well,
That, for all they care, I can go to hell.
But on earth indifference is the least
We have to dread from men or beast.

How should we like it were the stars to burn
With a passion for us we could not return?
If equal affection cannot be,
Let the more loving one be me.
